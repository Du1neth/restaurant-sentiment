      "A well run store in a very busy part of the city.",
      "The food still sucks, BUT they've got a guy playing piano upstairs, a cool vibe, AND The staff all wear saucy berets.",
      "Clean, fast, and good -- that is how a McD's should be!",
      "If you need a McFlurry ior some Atomic Wings at 2am (and who hasn't?!!), they are there.",
      "The order taker had given me plenty of ketchup in my bag but not enough salt and pepper packets.",
      "Rude personal with no interest for the wishes, customers could have. I guess, whether the horrible circumstances cause their behaviors. May be. It's ok to get a cool drink and cool down.",
      "Dirty, kept waiting ages and staff are rude too. Really was a terrible experience. Iâ€™d rather go without eating than visit this MacDonalds again.",
      "We ate here twice. The food was good. Fast and hot and exactly as it should be. But the staff, bar one employee were not the best.",
      "Not bad but again, staff were indifferent. The food was as you'd expect for a McDonald's and there was usually plenty of seating upstairs if you couldn't sit downstairs.",
      "Was going to have breakfast in hotel. Looked at choice and cost. Decide to walk around the corner to Mac restaurant. Two lovely servers smiles and friendly. Had full breakfast eggs sausage pancakes granola with yogart and fruit. And great coffee. 10 dollers. Bargin and great quality.",
      "The food was what is expected from a MacDonald however the service was very good and the staf were excellent.",
      "Usual McDo, but better vs NYC standard. Quite modern, friendly staff, clean. Not big, but enough seating for a quick lunch. Quality consistent with other McDo.",
      "When walking down 6th, you will find the McDonalds. There is usual a homeless beggar or two out front, bring some quarters or a dollar. The line is on the left and moves quick. The best place for eating is upstairs. Best to send someone upstairs to grab a table, and someone else make the order and pay for it. Just expect McDonalds and a busy one. So table not perfectly clean, trash not perfectly emptied, and a few homeless people biding their time.",
      "This was next to my hotel, too tired after a day of travel to find anyplace else I sought out a salad. The beggar doorman with a paper cup in his had for tips was a little unsettling. The place was crowded and confusing where to order. After I ordered I was yelled at by an employee because I was not standing in the right place to pick up my to go order, I didn't see any signs to indicate I needed to stand in a specific spot. I took my salad back to the hotel, worst salad I have ever been served. I threw most of it away.",
      "I've found that food at almost all McDonald's restaurants is pretty consistent -- fresh and reasonably priced. This location was no exception. The primary issue with McD's in New York City is that it is difficult to clean the tables quick enough because of the volume of business. So, we wiped our own table with napkins!",
      "By visiting this McDonalds, you will at least know for sure what type of food you are getting! Very busy location, but seemed to be effecient.",
      "Much improved atmosphere & service, compared to years ago. This is near Macy's. This visit was for just one item: Oreo McFlurry. Quick Service, professional, & pleasant. McFlurry--GREAT!",
      "Management needs to do a better job training/ helping employees. Forgot our fries, forgot our drinks, we waited 20 minutes for a burger, they gave us cold coffee, and no one working the cash registers could speak/understand English.",
      "Food was typical of your regular McDonald's. Service was very slow and they didn't seem to have much focus on the customer. Basically wanted to just get you in and get you out. The place could have been cleaner.",
      "As is typical with McDonalds, service is fast and the queues move well. There is ample space for sitting downstairs or in the upper level where the bathrooms are. Ordered a meal which comes with pound burger, fries and a hot or cold drink. Juicy, tasty and affordable!"
